ConnecTI is a web-based educational social media application that serves as a forum for information and learning media for the community of Information Technology, Udayana University (TI UNUD). ConnecTI also serves as a place to display any achievements (academic and non-academic) while studying at TI UNUD. 

ConnecTI is a web-based application that I and my friends were working on for our final project in the software engineering subject (RPL). This project was built with HTML, Bootstrap, and PHP.
